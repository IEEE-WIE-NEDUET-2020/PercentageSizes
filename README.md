 Old answer:

There is now a better way that came out with support library version 23.0.0 (about time, right?). You can now use PercentFrameLayout or PercentRelativeLayout. They both have the following attributes:

- layout_widthPercent
- layout_heightPercent
- layout_marginPercent
- layout_marginLeftPercent
- layout_marginTopPercent
- layout_marginRightPercent
- layout_marginBottomPercent
- layout_marginStartPercent
- layout_marginEndPercent

You can also take a look at PercentLayoutHelper.PercentLayoutParams
